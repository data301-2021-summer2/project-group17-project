## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{As a biology major with a particular interest in marine wildlife biology this dataset is extremely interesting to me. I'm interested to explore the kinds of patterns that can be drawn from the data and to think about how this information could be applied to conservation efforts and changing how animals are treated in captivity. I will be exploring research questions such as: Are some species of cetacean captured more often than others? Is one sex more likely to be captured or rescued than another? What is the average length of time spent in captivity before either death or release? Using the origin location variable, are some locations more likely to yield captured and/or rescued individuals? I think this dataset being represented in a user-facing dashboard will be a very helpful way to conceptualize and visualize the patterns that can be deduced from the data.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{This dataset contains information regarding specific individuals of cetaceans that were held in captivity in the United States between 1938 and 2017. Cetaceans are an order of mammals including whales, dolphins, and porpoises. It contains 2194 rows and 21 columns, and it's purpose is for public interest and a criticism of the marine animal captivity industry. This data was used in The Pudding article "Free Willy and Flipper by the Numbers", and was originally sourced from the US National Marine Mammal Inventory and Ceta-Base. This dataset spans data from March 1, 1938 to May 7, 2017 and was recorded by a human. It was downloaded from the databases June 15, 2015 and May 7, 2017 respectively. The dataset includes numbers, dates, and text detailing the information about each animal, its life history, and lineage.}
